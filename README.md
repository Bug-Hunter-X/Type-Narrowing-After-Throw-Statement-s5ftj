# Type Narrowing After Throw Statement in TypeScript

This code demonstrates an uncommon error in TypeScript related to type narrowing after a throw statement.  In the `operate` function, if a division by zero is attempted, an error is thrown. However, TypeScript's type narrowing system doesn't correctly handle the case where the `throw` statement is executed.  This leads to a runtime error, even though the compiler might not initially report an error.  This is because type narrowing only happens when the control flow reaches the end of a `case` or `if` block, and `throw` immediately exits that block.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Compile and run the provided TypeScript code (bug.ts).
2.  Observe the runtime error caused by the uninitialized variable `result`.

## Solution

The provided solution (bugSolution.ts) shows how to correctly handle this situation using a default case in the switch statement or by avoiding the throw statement in conditional operations.
